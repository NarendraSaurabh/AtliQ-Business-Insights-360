# AtliQ-Business-Insights-360
Full Fledged Power Bi Project
Hello everyone 👋 Exciting News!  🚀

I'm thrilled to share my first video presentation on the "Business Insights 360" project.
In this journey, I've explored finance, sales, supply, management, and marketing to gain a 360-degree view of our business.

✍ Problem Statement: AtliQ Technologies, a thriving hardware company specializing in peripherals, faced a significant challenge in LATIN AMERICA. Their quest? To rectify the issue through data-driven decision-making.

🔄 Project Goal:
"The primary mission of this project was to craft a holistic report that offers an insightful overview of Atliq Hardware's performance, all powered by the capabilities of Power BI.

🔍 Key Insights:
In this project, I've broken down the complex business data into five easy-to-understand views:

1. Finance View:
Here, we look at important numbers (KPIs) and elements of the P & L Statement.
We identify the best and worst products and customers for each element of the P & L Statement.

2. Sales View and Marketing View:
We dive into how well customers and products are doing.
We evaluate and visualize key figures like Net Sales and Gross Margin, making it easy to spot trends.
We will also give you insights into unit economics and marketing trends.

3. Supply Chain View:
This view focuses on metrics like forecast accuracy, Net Error, ABS Error, and risk factors for customers and products.
It helps you understand trends in Net error and forecast accuracy.

4. Executive View:
This one's for the big bosses! It provides essential metrics for senior executives to make decisions.
We cover key data for subzones, AtliQ market share, top customers and products by revenue, and revenue breakdown by divisions and channels.
